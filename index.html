# Webhooks @ Braintree

???

* Thank you everyone for making it to my talk
* I'm Brian, a developer at Braintree Payments
* Tonight I want to talk to you about webhooks
* I imagine many of you have and use webhooks in applications that you work with
* They're a powerful way to allow 3rd party services to initiate communication with your systems
* Our merchants use our webhooks in order be alerted to and respond to changes in state within the Braintree system
* But I'm getting ahead of myself...

---

# Webhooks @ Braintree

* Webhooks Overview
* Evented Web Servers
* Webhook Worker
* Problems

???

* In the next x minutes I plan to give you an overview of what webhooks are and how we use them at Braintree
* Getting into the details of our webhook worker, I'll briefly talk about th
* I'll cover the evented-web framework that we use to serve up webhooks
* Finally, I'll share with you some of the problems that we've had with our approach

---

# Webhooks Overview

* Simply Callbacks
* Triggered by an Event
* Consumers can Consume

???

* webhooks are simply http callbacks
* they're triggered by an event within our system
  * i'll get into some of those in just a minute
* merchants can consume these callbacks to trigger events within their system

---

# Webhooks Overview: Events

* Subscriptions
* Disbursement
* Partners
* Marketplace/Sub Merchants

[Webhook Triggers](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/javascript+python/sdk/server/webhooks/triggers)

???

* Much like DOM elements in a browser, our domain objects have events that can happen asynchronously
* These events can trigger a webhook if enabled

* Subscriptions
  * Canceled
  * Expired
  * Trial Ended
  * Went Past Due
  * Charged Successfully
  * Charged Unsuccessfully
  * Went Active
* Transactions
  * Disbursement
  * Disbursed (deprecated)
* Partners
  * Connected
  * Declined
  * Disconnected
* Marketplace/Sub Merchants
  * Approved
  * Declined
  * Disbursement Exception

---

# Webhooks Overview: Details

* Domain Object's Event Occurs
* Message is Produced & Enqueued
* Webhook Worker Consumes Message
* Webhook POSTed
* Merchant Receives & Verifies

???

* let's take a subscription for example
* and assume a merchant has enabled subscription charge successfully webhooks
* if it has a billing day of today, then it will be charged
* and a successfully charged webhook will be enqueued to be sent out
* once the webhook worker is able to send out the next request, it consumes it off of the queue
* and POSTs it to the endpoint the merchant has configured
* Once received, the merchant should verify the message's signature and can take whatever action is needed

---

# Webhooks Overview: Architecture

* Gateway/Peripheral Applications/Banks
* Queue (RabbitMQ)
* Webhook Worker
* Merchant Server

???

* If our recurring billing background job successfully charges a subscription,
* if a marketplace sub merchant or partner merchants is approved,
* or if a merchant had disbursed transaction, the gateway with enqueue a message to send via a webhook
* The webhook worker consumes the message to be sent
* Finally the merchant server successfully receives the message

---

# Webhooks Overview: Webhook Worker

* Consumes messages from queue
* POSTs message to merchant's endpoint
* ACKs message off queue if POSTed successful (2xx)
* ACKs but requeues with 1 hour delay if unsuccessful
* Drops message after 24 hours of trying (once an hour)

???

* It does all of this but for 100s if not 1000s of simultaneous webhook requests
* [Transition] How is it able to do this?

---

# Evented Web Server

* Web Server
* Single-Threaded
* Non-blocking

???

* Tornado is an evented, non-blocking web server that runs in a single thread
* Running in a single thread doesn't mean it's truly non-blocking requests
* But non-blocking I/O
* Our webhook requests are I/O bound, mostly waiting for a request from the merchant's endpoint
* Our webhooks are not CPU bound; the application code keeps track of request rates to prevent us from

---

# Evented Web Server: Non-blocking I/O

* `select`
* `epoll` (Linux)
* `kqueue` (BSD)

[Working with TCP Sockets by Jesse Storimer](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-tcp-sockets)

???

* I'm going to quickly walk down the stack before talking about the traditional architecture of an evented web server
* I mentioned non-blocking I/O but what is that?
* Modern operating systems have to deal with concurrency and give the application the ability to do other work while waiting on IO
* Select is the oldest of the three, returning the status of an open IO file handler
* Epoll, a Linux kernel call, is a more performant way to query the status of IO
* Kqueue, is the BSD-equivilent to epoll
* When any of the IO file handlers have something to read or write then the file handler will be returned from the call to be used
* I'll show you how this fits into the system as a whole

___

# Evented Web Server

*   Resources
  *   Socket/HTTP connections
*   Synchronous event demultiplexer
  *   Main IO loop
*   Dispatcher
  *   Un/register and call handlers
*   Request handler
  * "Synchronous" callback code

???

* An evented web server typically is comprised of 4 elements
* resources, a event demultiplexer, a dispatcher, and request handlers
* resources are IO file handles, for our webhoook worker pending webhook requests and the connection to rabbit
* the event demultiplexer is the main io loop. it yields time to IO that's ready to be read from or written to
* the dispatcher is what registers and unregisters resources with a callback and invokes the call handler when the resource is ready
* the request handler is the synchronous callback code that one writes for the Event Web Server
* tornado has ways of decorating these methods to be used asynchronously

---

# Evented Web Server: Main Goal

* DON'T BLOCK THE EVENT LOOP!!!
* [Async HTTP Client](http://tornado.readthedocs.org/en/branch2.2/httpclient.html#tornado.httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient)
* [Tasks](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/gen.html#tornado.gen.engine)
* [Futures](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/gen.html#tornado.gen.coroutine)

???

* The event loop is basically a for loop querying the OS for the status of open IO resources
* When our webhook worker makes an outbound request to a merchant's endpoint, it uses this call
  * the code that used the client waits for the response before continuing
* Consuming, acknowledging, and requeuing messages to Rabbit is accomplished through Pika's Tornado adapter
  * Pika will just continually check for new messages to consume, reading as much as it can
* Tornado has ways of abstracting asynchronous code with Tasks and Futures
  * Futures are the conventional way now
  * we used Tasks to abstract the calls to the merchant endpoints
  * this allows us to worry about retrying and requeueing on a different level

---

# Webhook Worker

* Setup Connection with Rabbit
* Send Webhooks and Acknowledge
* Retry Every Hour
* Give Up after 24 hours

???

* So how do we do all of this with Tornado?
* Let's walk through the flow of first how the worker is initialized
* Then how a message is sent and any subsequent retry

---

# Webhook Worker: Startup

* IO Loop Starts

```python
io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance()

worker = webhook_worker.Worker(
    io_loop=io_loop
    queue_name=args.queue_name,
    stats_collector=stats_collector,
    rabbitmq_host=args.rabbitmq_host,
    rabbitmq_port=args.rabbitmq_port,
    destination_wait=args.destination_wait,
    http_timeout=args.http_timeout)

worker.start()

io_loop.start()
```

---

# Webhook Worker: Worker Startup

* Worker starts the clients
* Worker registers a callback for message consumption

```python
class Worker(object):

    def __init__(self, io_loop,
                 queue_name, rabbitmq_host, rabbitmq_port,
                 destination_wait, http_timeout):
        # initializes the Rabbit and HTTP Clients

    @tornado.gen.engine
    def start(self):
        syslogger.warn("Starting worker")
        yield tornado.gen.Task(self.client.start)
        self.client.consume(self._receive_from_queue)
```

---

# Webhook Worker: Client Startup

* Initializes Rabbit Client
* Builds the Client Connection

```python
class Client(object):

    @tornado.gen.engine
    def start(self, callback):
        yield tornado.gen.Task(self._build_pika_client)
        callback()

    @tornado.gen.engine
    def _build_pika_client(self, callback):
        self.connection = yield tornado.gen.Task(self._build_connection)
        self.channel = yield tornado.gen.Task(self._build_channel, self.connection)
        self.queue = yield tornado.gen.Task(self.channel.queue_declare, \
            queue=self.queue_name, durable=True, arguments={"x-ha-policy":"all"})
        callback()
```

???

* the initialization of the Rabbit client is basically an abstraction around the setup of the rabbit connect, channel and queue
* as you see this is accomplished by the use of Tornado's Tasks
* the invokation of `callback()` tells Tornado this call is complete
  * if any parameters were passed then they would be returned from the yield call
  * as you see in `client.start`

---

# Webhook Worker: Consuming

* Pika Connection is non-blocking
* Consume calls Pika's `basic_consume`
* `self._handle_consume(callback)` returns consumer handler

```python
class Client(object):

    def consume(self, callback):
        self.channel.basic_consume(
            consumer_callback=self._handle_consume(callback),
            queue=self.queue_name)
```

---

# Webhook Worker: Sending Webhooks

* tornado.httpclient sends the request
* `yield`s until a response


```python
class Worker(object):

    @tornado.gen.engine
    def _receive_from_queue(self, message):
        syslogger.info("Receiving message from queue", message.id)
        # ...
        request = tornado.httpclient.HTTPRequest(...)

        http_request_logline = "Sending HTTP request ..."
        syslogger.info(http_request_logline, message.id)

        response = yield tornado.gen.Task(self.http_client.fetch, request)
        self._handle_http_response(response, message)
```

---

# Webhook Worker: Rate Limiting

* Worker tracks endpoints next request time
* Staggers requests to a single endpoint
* Timeout causes request to wait

```python
class Worker(object):

    @tornado.gen.engine
    def _receive_from_queue(self, message):
        syslogger.info("Receiving message from queue", message.id)

        next_request_time = self.minimum_next_request_times[message.destination]
        self.minimum_next_request_times[message.destination] = \
            max(next_request_time, time.time()) + self.destination_wait

        syslogger.info("Will request at %s" % [next_request_time], message.id)

        yield tornado.gen.Task(self.io_loop.add_timeout, next_request_time)
        # ...
```

---

# Webhook Worker: Acknowledgement

```python
class Worker(object):

    def _ack(self, message):
        syslogger.info("Acking", message.id)
        message.ack()

    def _handle_http_response(self, response, message):
        syslogger.info("Processing HTTP response", message.id)
        if 200 <= response.code < 300:
            self._ack(message)
        else:
            # ...
```

---

# Webhook Worker: Retry

* If < 24 attempts
  * Acknowledges original message
  * Requeues message with incremented failure count
* If >= 24 attempts
  * Acknowledges original message
  * Doesn't requeue

---

# Webhook Worker: Retry

```python
class Worker(object):

    def _handle_http_response(self, response, message):
        syslogger.info("Processing HTTP response", message.id)
        if 200 <= response.code < 300:
            # ...
        else:
            http_error_logline = "Received ..."
            syslogger.info(http_error_logline, message.id)
            syslogger.info("Requeuing", message.id)
            self._requeue_message(message)

    @tornado.gen.engine
    def _requeue_message(self, message):
        message.increment_failure_count()
        if message.should_retry:
            yield tornado.gen.Task(self.io_loop.add_timeout, \
                time.time() + message.retry_delay)
            self.client.produce(message.body, headers=message.headers)
        else:
            syslogger.err("Giving up retrying", message.id)

        self._ack(message)
```

# Problems

* Callbacks
* AMQP Heartbeats
* Tornado HTTPClient Limit
* Endpoint Verification in Ruby
* Python 2 & SNI

---

# Problems: Callbacks

* Deceivingly synchronous-looking code
* Logging was inconsistent
* Callbacks difficult to follow

---

# Problems: AMQP Heartbeat

* AMQP heartbeat timeouts caused the Pika to raise without being caught
* Disabled heartbeat since traffic maintains connection

---

# Problems: HTTPClient Limit

* A large number of webhook messages to a handful of merchants with slow endpoints
* Tornado's HTTP Client defaults to 10 concurrent connections
* These 2 things coupled caused the event loop not to be able to queue up more outbound connections

---

# Problems: Endpoint Verification in Ruby

* Gateway in Ruby
* Verification of Subdomains Different from Python

---

# Problems: Python 2 & SNI

* Python 2 doesn't support SNI
* We don't support webhooks via HTTPS to different hostnames on the same IP
* Moving to Python 3 for support
